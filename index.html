            <p>I myself am a huge fan of pretty much anything with wheels and an engine. <br> Here are a few facts a bout my car that I found to be pretty interesting. </p>
            <img src="/images/blue-speed.webp" alt="">
           <ol>
               <li>The mazdaspeed team was born in 1991 by the hands of Mazda's Tokyo distributor, Takayoshi Ohashi.</li> <img src="/images/black-speed.webp" alt="">
               <li>Mazda introduced the first generation Mazdaspeed 3 in 2007. It was their response to the Golf GTI and Subaru Impreza WRX.</li>
               <li>Mazda never offered either of the two generations with an automatic transmission, so the six-speed manual is the only choice.</li> <img src="/images/purp-speed.webp" alt="">
               <li> Both also received the optional Bose speaker setup.</li> <img src="/images/msp3.webp" alt="">
               <li>The Mazdaspeed 3 is an excellent hot hatchback deal, with spades of reliability, smiles per miles and pretty cool exterior styling too.</li>

           </ol>

            <p>Another thing that helps quite the voices is the smell and sound of some niece boomstickes or (firearms). </p>
            <img src="/images/pew-509.jpg" alt="">
            <ol>
              <li> Gunpowder was invented by the Chinese in the 9th century.</li>  <img src="/images/Pew1.jpg" alt="">

              <li> The first gun was made in 1000 AD in China. </li> 

               <li>It was made up of bamboo and used gunpowder to fire a spear. </li> <img src="/images/shadow.jpg" alt="">

               <li> In the late 14th century, smaller and portable hand-held cannons were developed, creating in effect the first smooth-bore personal firearm.</li> 
               <img src="/images/pew-45.webp" alt="">

               <li>The weapon safety rules

                Treat every weapon as if it were loaded.
                <br>                
                Never point your weapon at anything you do not intend to shoot.
                <br>
                Keep your finger straight and off the trigger until you intend to fire.
                <br>
                Keep your weapon on safe until you intend to fire. </li> 
             </ol>
